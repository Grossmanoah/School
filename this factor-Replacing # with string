const robot = {
  _energyLevel: 100,
  //Replaced the number with High when I called it at the bottom.
  recharge(){
    this._energyLevel += 30;
    console.log(`Recharged! Energy is currently at ${this._energyLevel}%.`)
  }
};

robot._energyLevel = 'high';
robot.recharge();


//this callled both the number and the string of 'High'


This was the output:
Recharged! Energy is currently at high30%.
















---------------------------------------------------------Getter

//In robot, create a getter method named energyLevel using the get keyword. Leave function body blank for now.
const robot = {
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  get energyLevel(){
    if(typeof this._energyLevel === 'number') {
      return 'My current energy level is ' + this._energyLevel
    } else {
      return "System malfunction: cannot retrieve energy level"
    }
  }
};

console.log(robot.energyLevel);



//Inside the getter method, add an if statement to check if this._energyLevel is a
number using the typeof operator. If that condition is truthy, return 'My current energy level is 
ENERGYLEVEL'. Replace ENERGYLEVEL with the value of this._energyLevel.

Make sure you return the string and not logging it to the console.



OUTPUT:
My current energy level is 100
